 * 
 * A splay tree is a self-adjusting binary search tree with the additional property 
 * that recently accessed elements are quick to access again. It performs basic operations 
 * such as insertion, look-up and removal in O(log n) time.
 * 
 * Using the operation, SPLAY, it rearranges the tree so the desired element that we want, say x, 
 * is placed at the root of the splay tree. 
 * 
 * This class is implemented in the CityRoster class. Has the basic operations of printing
 * out the toString (inorder format), insertion, search, and deletion. A more detailed algorithm 
 * for each method will be explained prior to each method. In this project, we are asked to implement 
 * a Dictionary ADT using a SPLAYTREE. We will store a key (in a Point object, thus coordinates) and 
 * a value (in a String object). 
 * 
 * Splay trees have advantages and disadvantages. For example, because of the method of "splay"ing,
 * the desired node can be accessed easily because it is at the root. However, it is also bad because
 * lets just say the desire node you want to remove is the largest or the smallest, that means the tree
 * can be reorganized as a linkedlist, providing a linear runtime
